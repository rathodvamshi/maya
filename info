ðŸ”¹ 1. Install & Run Neo4j with Docker

Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running.
ðŸ‘‰ Download Docker
 if you donâ€™t already have it.

Open PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

Run this command:

docker run --name maya-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password123 \
  neo4j:latest


What this does:

--name maya-neo4j â†’ Easy container name.

-p 7474:7474 â†’ Web UI access at http://localhost:7474
.

-p 7687:7687 â†’ Port for your Python backend to talk to Neo4j.

NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password123 â†’ Default login credentials.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Verify itâ€™s Running

Open your browser â†’ go to: http://localhost:7474

Login with:

Username â†’ neo4j

Password â†’ password123

ðŸ‘‰ If you see the Neo4j Browser Console, congrats ðŸŽ‰ your AI brain is alive!

ðŸ”¹ 3. (Optional) Keep Data Persistent

By default, if you stop/remove the container, your graph data is lost. To make it persistent, mount a volume:

docker run --name maya-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password123 \
  neo4j:latest


This way, your facts & relationships stay saved across restarts.

âœ… Thatâ€™s it â€” Neo4j is running and ready to start storing users, facts, memories, and relationships.
ðŸ‘‰ Next step will be connecting your FastAPI backend to this Neo4j brain so your AI can save and query knowledge.

Do you want me to jump straight into Step 2: Connect FastAPI â†’ Neo4j (Python driver setup + test query)?

You are connected as user neo4j
to neo4j://localhost:7687
Connection credentials are stored in your web browser.

ðŸ”¥ Perfect â€” that means your Neo4j brain is alive and listening at

neo4j://localhost:7687


with the neo4j user.
