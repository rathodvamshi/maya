 Fix the Neo4j Connection
First, check if your Neo4j Docker container is running.

Open a new terminal (not a project terminal).

Run the command: docker ps

Look for a container named maya-neo4j.

If you dont see it in the list, it means the container is stopped. Start it with this command:

Bash

docker start maya-neo4j
If it is running on "http://localhost:7474/browser/", double-check that the NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USER, and NEO4J_PASSWORD in your backend/.env file are correct.

Username → neo4j

Password → password123

 How the AIs Memory Works Now:
Your AI, Maya, now has a sophisticated, three-layered brain:

Short-Term Memory (Redis): When youre in a conversation, Maya uses Redis to track the current state (e.g., planning_trip) and remember the last few messages. This is its "working memory," keeping it focused on the current task.

Mid-Term Memory (Pinecone): After a conversation ends and is archived, a summary is stored in Pinecone. When you start a new chat, Maya uses Pinecone to find similar past conversations. This is how it remembers general context, like "Last time, we were talking about a trip to Paris."

Long-Term Memory (Neo4j): After every single message, a background task analyzes the conversation for facts (like "My name is Vamshi" or "I like museums"). These facts are stored in the Neo4j knowledge graph as permanent nodes and relationships. When you start any chat, Maya first checks this graph for hard facts about you, allowing it to greet you by name and remember your preferences forever.

In simple terms: You now have a fully functional AI assistant. It can chat with you, learn from your conversations in real-time, remember you across different sessions, and use its memory to provide smarter, more personalized responses.
